Supabase Edge Functions Configuration Instructions
=====================================================

Please follow these steps in your Supabase Dashboard:

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/rpsfupahfggkpfstaxfx/settings/functions

2. For each Edge Function (credits, admin-credits, etc.), configure:
   
   a) Environment Variables:
      - Add: VERIFY_JWT = false
      - Add: ALLOW_ANONYMOUS = true
      - Add: CUSTOM_JWT_ISSUER = pagent-siwe-auth

   b) Function Settings:
      - Set "Verify JWT" to: Disabled
      - Or set "JWT Verification" to: Custom
      
3. Alternative: Global Configuration
   Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/rpsfupahfggkpfstaxfx/settings/api
   
   - Find "Service Role JWT Secret"
   - Add custom JWT verification rules
   - Or disable JWT verification for Edge Functions

4. If the above options are not available:
   - We need to use the Service Role Key approach
   - Update frontend to send Service Role Key in Authorization header
   - Send SIWE JWT in X-Custom-Auth header
